    * [PokéAPI - Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
    * [STAPI - Star Trek API](http://stapi.co/)
    * [LOTR API](https://the-one-api.herokuapp.com/documentation)
…or any other similar kind of API that you like.

 1. Fetches data from an external API
2. Implements TypeScript typings for Components as well as for data fetched from API and saved to the app state
3. Implements app state management of your choice
4. Implements a design of your choice
5. Includes a mock authentication functionality, saving a fake token to memory in order to let the user to the private root of the main app view after reloading or reopening the tab
6. Data presented as cards on a grid of your choice
7. Cards include shortened data from their respective data nodes and navigate to full data view when clicked
8. Allows users to access respective data nodes views by a URL with a name, e.g. `~/Tatooine` to access Tatooine planet full data view in case of Star Wars
9. Implements search and filter functionalities to be determined by you
10. Hosted on your own GitHub, please provide us with a link and how to start instruction so that we can take a look at your work

Notes
You are welcome to use whatever boilerplate or starting project you prefer, mind that we will look at your choice of your development stack as well. The ability to set up or edit already created boilerplate is always a big plus.
We would like to see how you handle a project newly given to you, so it goes without saying that the more you write yourself, the better we’ll be able to evaluate your skills. It’s not only about the ability to smack a bunch of node modules together :)
